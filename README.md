# Data-stractures-and-algorithms

I created this repositor to practice typescript by implementing different data structures and algorithms in my spare time.

Already implemented:

Generic [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))

Generic [PriorityQueue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue)

Dependencies:

 [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework.
 
 [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) to run typescript.
 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Which will run index.ts with example of instantiating Generic class.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
